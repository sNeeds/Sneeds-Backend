Regarding an IELTS overall 5.5 or lower, You need to know that it is not possible to apply to abroad universities worldwide at all. \
It is not valid even for the minimum requirement of their language proficiency score. \
So it is almost necessary for you to retake the test and get a higher score. "

IELTS_ACADEMIC_5H = " Unfortunately, I have to tell you that if you are planning to pursue a master's or doctoral degree at a university in Canada, the United States, Australia or Europe, this score will not be enough. \
Of course, it is possible to apply to some middle-level universities, such as the University of Missouri or Murray State University, but keep in mind that getting a visa may make it difficult for you to continue your migration process. \
Note that this score is sufficient for many Italian universities to apply at all levels, but ultimately you will need a score of 6 to successfully obtain a visa. \
You can also apply with a score of 5.5 if you intend to study at a bachelor's degree or college, or if you can study at a language course in the destination country. \
As a result, my suggestion is to focus on the language for a while so that you can get a score of at least 6.5 or higher to boost your resume and also Increase your chances of being accepted into your favorite university."

IELTS_ACADEMIC_6 = "With" + " this score, you can apply to some European universities, \
such as Italy . Also, the minimum English proficiency requirement for bachelor's degrees and colleges in many parts of the world is 6. Universities in Canada, the United States, and Australia often require a score of 6.5 or higher, and if you apply with the lower score, usually two things will happen: \
One is that you will be given a definite admission but will be forced to take a language course after migrating to the destination country. \
The next case is that conditional admission is given; That is, you will be given a specific time until you can get the required score. \
Note that in most cases, when it is said that the minimum university requirement is a score of 6.5, a score of 6 will not be accepted under almost any circumstances. \
So maybe this score will limit you a little, and you need to improve. \
But if this change is not possible for you, with a little search you can find many universities that accept the same score; For example, many universities in China, New Zealand, England, etc. \
By the way, if you are planning to continue your doctoral studies, have this good news! Many European universities do not require a language degree for a doctorate!"

IELTS_ACADEMIC_6H = "An IELTS score of 6.5 with a score of 6 in each skill is the minimum required by many universities worldwide. \
With this score, you can apply to a large number of universities. You can find many universities in the United States that require this score for master and doctoral degrees. \
This is often enough for a master's degree in Canada. Still, some top universities, such as McGill or a Ph.D. in many universities, will ask you for a score of 7. \
The UK is the same, but many European universities may ask you to score 6 or 6.5. \
You may also need a 7 score in specific courses such as literature, music, history, medicine, law, and the like. \
So you have to be careful, if you want to apply to a university that needs a grade of 7, you may get conditional admission, but later, you will have to try again to get a grade of 7! \
Of course, keep in mind that if your total IELTS score is 6.5 but one of the sections is below 6, you may be accepted by this score by correspondence with professors or the admissions office. \
As a result, you are very open with this score, and you have a lot of choices to apply. \
Good Luck!"

Most universities in Australia ask you to do the same. In some European countries, such as Italy, a much lower language score, such as 6, is required at all levels, so you are far ahead. \
So, in general, your score is enough to apply to universities except for top universities such as Oxford, Harvard, or ETH Zurich. \
You may also need a score of 7.5 in specific courses such as literature, music, history, medicine, law and the like. \
Just be careful; they may specify a minimum for each skill that you must have! For example, a writing score of 7 along with a total score of 7. \
As a result, you have done an excellent job for the language, and you do not need to think about it anymore. So it is better to go to strengthen the rest parts of your resume."

A score of IELTS 7.5 is evidence that your English is good enough to join any university course, even at elite Oxbridge and Ivy League institutions. \

such as the University of Missouri or Murray State University, \
but keep in mind that getting a visa in the future may make it difficult for you to continue your migration process. \
Note that this score is sufficient for many Italian universities to apply at all levels, but ultimately you will need a score of 85 and higher to successfully obtain a visa. \
You can also apply with a score of 78-85 if you intend to study at a bachelor's degree or college, or if you can study at a language course in the destination country. \
As a result, my suggestion is to focus on the language for a while so that you can get a score of at least 90  or higher to boost your resume and also Increase your chances of being accepted into your favorite university."

Also, the minimum English proficiency requirement for bachelor's degrees and colleges in many parts of the world is between 85 and 90. \

usually two things will happen: One is that you will be given a definite admission but will be forced to take a language course after migrating to the destination country. \
The next case is that conditional admission is given; That is, you will be given a specific time until you can get the required score. \
Note that in most cases, when it is said that the minimum university requirement is a score of 90, a score of 90 and lower will not be accepted under almost any circumstances. \
