                        than 100! Remember that software related to the \

# Bachelor university

BACHELOR_LAST_GRADE_START_UNIVERSITY_TEXT = "Your university of origin \
and grade point average (GPA) can be very influential at the undergraduate \
level due to accepting for a university and receiving funding. Because you usually \
do not have an essential academic degree to apply for and study for a master's degree, \
except for the name of university of origin, grade point average and language grade. \
Besides, only a small number of undergraduate students have articles and research records. \
Of course, keep in mind that many people on admissions committees believe that your \
educational background is so influential overall that the home university takes a small \
portion of it and a relatively large grade point average, which can differentiate students. \
In any case, you should have at least the required grade point average of your destination \
university, but the higher it is, the higher your chances among your competitors. \
But how effective the home university is in the chance of admission depends on two factors. \
One is how famous that university is in the world and your specific field (You can check the \
ranking of any university by subject on topuniversities.com (QS)), that is, whether it has a good ranking or not. \
The other is that if students from your university have already applied there, \
what was their overall performance and were they able to achieve the critical success \
or they just used the application process as a bridge to migrate! But if you are studying \
at an utterly unknown university, do not worry. The rest of your resume should be significant. \
A resume has many sections that in case of weakness in each case, it is possible to strengthen it in other areas. \
You can apply for a master's degree at universities worldwide and a direct doctorate (Ph.D.) for American universities. \
The field you intend to apply for must be partially related to the area of expertise. \
If you want to change the field, you must have passed the course in the field of interest, \
or at least have relevant work experience and show that you have good information. "
